          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This project focuses on predicting different sleep stages using
            wearable sensor data to help detect sleep disorders such as insomnia
            and sleep apnea. The solution comprises of two classifying machine
            learning models working together. One of the models is used to
            classify the sleep stage of a person based on the readings from ppg
            sensor. The other model classifies if a person has sleep disorder or
            not based on the sleep metrics. The code implementation for this
            project can be found

            Two different dataset are required for this project to develop the
            models. The ppg sensor data were obtained from
            <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7775567">here</a>
            and the dataset with patients details about sleep metrics and

          <h2>Feature Extraction (Statistical features from PPG)</h2>
          <p>
            As a part of the project, a pre-processing script that is capable of
            extracting statistical features required to predict the sleep stage
            was developed and tested with a sample PPG recording
          </p>
          <p>
            The sample ppg recording was obtained from this
            <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/yynb8t9x3d/1">link</a>

            The supporting script consists of class PPGFeatureExtractor which
            takes in the signal amplitude values as input and returns the
            necessary features.

          <h2>Machine Learning model for sleep stage classification</h2>
          <p>
            The next step in this project is to develop a classifier model that
            is capable of finding which stage of sleep a patient is in using the
            extracted features.
          </p>
          <p>The classes of the target variable (sleep stage) are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>0 - NREM1</li>
            <li>1 - NREM2</li>
            <li>2 - NREM3/4</li>
            <li>4 - REM</li>
            <li>5 - AWAKE</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The detailed analysis and coding can be found in this
            <a

            The following models were developed as part of the analysis and
            tested for metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall etc to decide
            which is the best model.
          </p>
          <p><strong>MODELS:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Logistic Regression</li>
            <li>Random Forest</li>

            <li>LSTM</li>

          <p>
            The results and report achieved for each model is shown in the
            notebook. In the analysis, two paths were chosen to train the model.
            Initially the models were trained with a single patient's data and
            then to make the model more generalised, a combined dataset of 10
            patients were created to train and ealuate the model's performance.
            Among these results, the stacking classifier proved to be the best
            solution and the architecture and results are shown below.

            Different classifiers were tested and the Random Classifier

              Both the datasets are comparitively small and are usefull only for
              academic purposes. Real-time large dataset need to be collected
              and used for product development.

            <li>
              I have not used the sleep stage values that is predicted by the
              model for the next step in which the sleep metrics are calculated
              since the ppg values used by the authors of first dataset is
              unknown and the sample which I have taken is of different format.
              This should be addressed.
            </li>
            <li>
              A real-time dashboard should be built to monitor the sleep stages,
              metrics and the details regarding the presence of sleep disorder.
