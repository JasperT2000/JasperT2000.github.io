          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            This report presents an analysis of the Data Science Stack Exchange
            site using the most recent data dump. The goal is to gain insights
            into the data, with a focus on text extraction and visualization. We
            will be additionally using regex patterns to extract the necessary
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The notebook containing the analysis can be found
            <a
              href="https://github.com/JasperT2000/datastack_analysis/blob/main/stack_analysis.ipynb"

            A detailed instuction page on how to access the data dump can be
            found

          <h3>Analysis</h3>
          <h5>Wordcloud on titles of posts</h5>
          <p>
            The first plot is to find the most repetitive words in titles among
            the posts that have been posted throughout. We will bw doing this
            with the help of 'wordcloud' package.
          </p>
          <img src="images/wordcloud.png" alt="Word Cloud" class="image" />
          <hr />
          <h5>Top tags used in posts</h5>
          <p>
            For the next part, we are going to analyse the tags of the posts
            data. A little pre-processing is required to remove the tag elements
            and to analyse them.
          </p>
          <img src="images/tags.png" alt="Tags" class="image" />
          <p>
            The most used tags in posts are
            <strong>"Machine learning", "Pandas" amd "Python"</strong>.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h5>Length of comments distribution</h5>
          <p>
            For the next plot, we will analyse how many characters are usually
            used to make comments in a post
          </p>
          <img src="images/comments.png" alt="Comments" class="image" />
          <hr />
          <h5>Different email domains used in the posts</h5>
          <p>
            In this part, we will check the top 10 email domains that are
            present in the comments. This requires a little pre-processing. We
            wil be using regex pattern to match the email address domain and
            retrieve them for analysis.
          </p>
          <img src="images/email.png" alt="Email" class="image" />
          <hr />
          <h5>Table to filter posts based on keywords</h5>
          <p>
            Next, we will create a table that shows details such as title of the
            post, author of the post and user's reputation score.

          </video>
          <hr />
          <h5>Number of Comments over the year</h5>
          <p>
            We will plot the number of comments over the time (monthly) to view
            when we have received a lot of comments and try to bring out some
            patterns. The following Python code uses Bokeh to create an
            interactive time series plot of the number of comments on posts
            containing specific keywords (data science or machine learning) in
            their titles.
          </p>
