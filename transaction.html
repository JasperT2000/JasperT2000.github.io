          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The dataset under consideration is a transaction record table from a
            supermarket chain purchase database. Through this analysis we will
            be bringing out sales pattern based on factors such as days,
            customer behaviour, product types etc. We will start by analysing
            the sales happened date-wise and proceed with more complex analysis
            such as basket-level analysis, Associative rule mining and analyse
            customer shopping behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            The notebook containing the analysis can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/JasperT2000/transaction">here.</a>
          </p>
          <p>The top five rows of the table is shown below.</p>

          <h3>Analysis</h3>
          <h5>Sales across the year</h5>
          <p>
            Firstly, we will make a line plot showing the total amount collected
            on every day across the year to find any potential patterns.
          </p>
          <img
            src="images/datesales.png"
            alt="Sales across days"
            class="image"
          />
          <p>
            From the plot, we can observe that the overall sales is at peak
            during the last quarter of the year. Also, during most of the
            months, the sale is at peak during first few days.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h5>Day-wise average sales across the year</h5>
          <p>
            In the next plot, we are going to find on which day the sales is
            going to be high considering the average sales of a day across the
            year.
          </p>

            class="image"
          />
          <p>
            <li>
              From the plot, we could find that most amount of sales take place
              on Sunday.
            </li>
            <li>
              The shop is closed on Tuesday since no transactions have been
              recorded.
            </li>
            <li>Weekend is more profitable and more customers are expected.</li>
          </p>
          <h5>Most items sold on Sundays</h5>
          <p>
            Next step is to find which items are sold most on Sundays so that
            the store can be prepared with some propmotions for these items.
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              The product with the highest revenue on Sunday is:
              <strong>PaperCraftLittleBirdie</strong>, with revenue: 501359.0625
            </li>
            <li>
              The product with the highest sales volume on Sunday is:
              <strong>PopcornHolder</strong>, with total Quantity: 16144
            </li>
          </p>

          <h5>Top 5 products based on profit</h5>
          <p>
            The next plot shows the most profitable products for the supemarket.

          <h5>Most profitable country</h5>

          <hr />
          <h5>Customer with most number of transactions</h5>
          <p>
            The customer with the highest shopping frequency is:<strong>
              12748</strong
            >
            with 207 distinct transactions.
          </p>

          <hr />
          <h5>Basket recreation</h5>
          <p>
            2 new columns were created, Product Category and productname_process
            to view the desired output. The dataset was grouped based on
            transaction and all the product category and product_name data were
            aggregated. The baskets representing each and every transaction is
            prepared for further analysis.
          </p>
          <img src="images/basket.png" alt="Basket" class="image" />
          <hr />
          <h5>Associative Data Mining</h5>
          <p>
            For this part, the table is pivotted with top 100 products as
            columns and transactions as rows. We will be analysing the purchase
            trennds followed by customers. Apriori algorithm is used for this
            purpose.
          </p>
          <img src="images/apriori1.png" alt="ARM1" class="image" />
          <p>
            From the above query and output, we can conclude that the products
            JumboBagPinkPolkadot and JumboBagRedRetrospot are frequently brought
            together in more than 5% of the total transactions
          </p>
          <img src="images/apriori2.png" alt="ARM1" class="image" />
          <img src="images/apriori3.png" alt="ARM1" class="image" />
          <img src="images/apriori4.png" alt="ARM1" class="image" />
          <img src="images/apriori5.png" alt="ARM1" class="image" />
          <p>
            From the above results, we can find that there are 962 transactions
            with a confidence level more than 60%. Hence the antecedent and the
            consequent can be placed together to boost up the sales.
          </p>
          <img src="images/apriori6.png" alt="ARM1" class="image" />
          <img src="images/apriori7.png" alt="ARM1" class="image" />
          <img src="images/apriori8.png" alt="ARM1" class="image" />
          <p>
            Another interesting finding is around 156 transactions are stronger
            with a large value of lift, higher confidence and also contribute to
            1.5% of the total transactions. These products can be announced for
            sales with some combo offers to attract customers.
          </p>

          <h5>Customer segmentation</h5>
          <img
            src="images/customerseg.png"
            alt="Customer segmentation"
            class="image"
          />
          <p>
            The solution is implemented using the euclidean_distances class from
            sklearn. The solution is optimal for this dataset. Alternatives for
            this question would be choosing other methodologies to calculate the
            distance such as Manhattan distance etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            To recommend products that the customer has never purchased before,
            we have come up with 2 approaches based on the previous tasks.
          </p>
          <p><strong>APPROACH 1:</strong></p>
          <p>
            Using Apriori analysis done in the basket analysis, we can analyze
            the purchase patterns of a customer and suggest that customer,
            products he/she has never bought.
          </p>
          <li>Identify the products brought by customer</li>
          <li>Compare the products with the results from Apriori Analysis</li>
          <li>Suggest the top products</li>
          <p><strong>APPROACH 2:</strong></p>
          <p>
            We can analyze the purchase patterns of customers similar to another
            customer, rank the products they have bought based on the quantity
            and then recommend the new products.
          </p>
          <li>Identify top 3 similar customers</li>
          <li>Analyze their basket data</li>
          <li>Suggest new products</li>

          <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
          The analysis has been successfully carried out and important findings
          have been reported. For future, a dashboard could be built to view all
          the data which would be helpful in story-telling. Also sales
          forecasting can be done with the help of Machine learning models.
